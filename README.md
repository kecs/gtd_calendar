![Sassy Brunch logo](https://raw.github.com/bc-luke/sassy-brunch/master/logo.png)

Sassy Brunch is a skeleton (boilerplate) for [Brunch](http://brunch.io)
based on [Chaplin](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin) framework and [Sass](https://github.com/nex3/sass).

Requires Brunch 1.4+.

## Getting started
* Create new project by executing `brunch new <project name> --skeleton https://github.com/bc-luke/sassy-brunch`.
* Build the project with `brunch b` or `brunch w`.
* Open the `public/` dir to see the result.
* Write your code.

See the [Chaplin github page](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin) and the [Sass github page](https://github.com/nex3/sass) for
documentation.

## Differences from Chaplin Boilerplate
[Chaplin Boilerplate](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin-boilerplate)
is an official boilerplate all for chaplin. This skeleton is almost the same,
except a few changes:

* Added Header.
* Added authentication abstractions (`SessionController`, `LoginView` etc).
* CommonJS is used instead of AMD, because it's easier to use & debug.

## Differences from Brunch with Chaplin
[Brunch with Chaplin](https://github.com/paulmillr/brunch-with-chaplin) is a default application skeleton for Brunch.
* Sass is used in place of Stylus.

## Features
* HTML5Boilerplate 4.0.0 html & css are included.
* CoffeeScript + Sass + Handlebars as app languages
(you can change this to anything you want)
* Backbone as main framework
* Supports IE8 and up.
* Cross-module communication using the Mediator and Publish/Subscribe patterns
* Controllers for managing individual UI views
* Rails-style routes which map URLs to controller actions
* An application view as dispatcher and view manager
* Extended model, view and collection classes to avoid repetition and
enforce conventions
* Strict memory management and object disposal
* A collection with additional manipulation methods for smarter change events
* A collection view for easy and intelligent list rendering
* Client-side authentication using service providers like Facebook, Google
and Twitter
